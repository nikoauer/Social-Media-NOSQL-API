# <Social-Network-API>

## Description

This is a NOSQL MongoDB API to mimic the CRUD actions of a social network. This allows users to add thoughts, friends and reactions, delete users, thoughts and friends, update users and thoughts and finally read the thoughts and the users. It was a good project to better understand the properties of using NOSQL databases and how despite the non traditional linking can still connect to each other in comparison to SQL databases. 


## Installation

Upon initially download or cloning this project open it in your respective code editor.

You will also need an API tool such as a Insomnia to test the API and MongoDB.

Once downloaded open your intergrated terminal in your code editor and npm install all the necessary dependancies with "npm install". Once done so you can start the program with the command "node server.js".
